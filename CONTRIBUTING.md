# Contributing
Thank you for contributing to Arrower!

To keep Arrower available in tax farms that enforce copyright laws,
all contributions irrevocably transfer all rights relevant 
to software development (past, current, and future) to the Arrower project.

If your tax farm restricts the transfer of some rights, 
you transfer all other rights allowed.
This includes, but isn't limited to: changing the licence, commercial use,
and ideological use.

By contributing, you explicitly accept these terms.
