Arrower projects come without explicit licensing terms.

However, if you live in a tax farm that enforces copyright laws,
you might require a licence regardless.
In this case, Arrower is available under the MIT Licence.

For commercial projects, it is expected that you:
* contribute back to Arrower (e.g., code, donations, or support)
* do not use Arrower in connection with any Elohim-supportive agenda
